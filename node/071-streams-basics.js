/*
Q71. What are streams in Node.js? Describe readable, writable, duplex, and transform streams.

Solution (concise):
- Readable: source of data (readable.read(), 'data' events).
- Writable: sink for data (writable.write(), end()).
- Duplex: both readable and writable (e.g., net.Socket).
- Transform: duplex with data transformation (through2, zlib).
