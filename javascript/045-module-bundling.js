/*
Q45. How does module bundling work? Compare Webpack, Rollup, esbuild.

Solution (concise):
- Bundlers analyze imports/exports, build dependency graph, emit optimized bundles.
- Webpack: feature-rich, loaders/plugins, code splitting.
- Rollup: ESM-first, tree-shaking for libraries.
- esbuild: extremely fast, good defaults, fewer ecosystem plugins.
